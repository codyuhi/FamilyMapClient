/** When a user logs into the server, the login request sent from the client to the server
 *  must include the user's username and password.  If the login succeeds, the server
 *  will generate a unique authorization token string for the user and return it to the client.
 *  Subsequent requests sent from the client to the server will include the auth token so the server
 *  can determine which user is making the request.  This allows non-login requests to be made without
 *  having to include the user's credentials, thus reucing the likelihood that a hacker will intercept them.
 *  For this scheme to work, the server will store auth tokens in its database and record which user
 *  each token belongs to.  Also to protect against the possibility that a hacker might intercept
 *  a user's auth token, it is important that each new login request generate and return a unique auth token.
 *  It should also be possible for the same user to be loggied in from multiple clients at the same time.
 *  This means that the same user to be logged in from multiple clients at the same time, which means
 *  that the same user could have multiple active auth tokens simultaneously
 *
 *  An auth token should be included in the HTTP "Authorization" request header for all requests that require an Auth token
