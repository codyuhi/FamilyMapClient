/** The Response class is a parent class to several types of responses that can be returned
 *  as a result of operations that are triggered when the client hits an endpoint on the server with a request
 *
 *  Response classes are important to define based on the different operations that the server supports.
 *  The client expects different schemas for data based on operation, so modularizing the types of responses
 *  allows for organization in how requests are responded to
